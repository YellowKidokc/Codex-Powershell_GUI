## Features

- **Root-based discovery**: Add any folder that contains scripts and the hub scans it recursively
- **Folder tree navigation**: Keep the real folder structure instead of flattening everything into one list
- **Quick filters**: Search by name, folder, root, or extension
- **One-click execution**: Launch `.ps1`, `.py`, `.bat`, and `.cmd` scripts
- **Console output**: See stdout and stderr inside the app
- **Pin favorites**: Mark your most-used scripts for quick access
- **Nested categories**: Create headings such as `Admin/Backups` or `APIs/GitHub`
- **Grouped imports**: Import several PowerShell, Python, batch, or command scripts into one category
- **Saved API calls**: Create reusable GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests and run them from the hub

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PowerShell 5.1+ on Windows, or PowerShell Core if you want `pwsh`

### Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python powershell_commander.py
   ```

### Windows Auto-Start

To make Codex Script Hub start with Windows:

1. Run `install_startup.bat`
2. Done! The app will now launch when Windows starts

To remove from startup:
- Run `uninstall_startup.bat`

## Usage

### Categories

- **Files**: File and folder operations (create, delete, zip, convert)
- **Computer**: System monitoring (CPU, RAM, drives, processes)
- **Network**: Network tools (DNS, ping, VPN, WiFi)
- **Audio**: Sound controls (volume, text-to-speech, play audio)
- **Apps**: Application management (open, close, install)
- **Dev**: Development tools (Git operations, build, clean)
- **Utils**: Utilities (weather, news, hash, screenshot)
- **Custom**: Your personal scripts

### Using the Hub

1. Click **Add Root** and choose a folder full of scripts.
2. The app scans that folder recursively and shows anything ending in `.ps1`, `.py`, `.bat`, or `.cmd`.
3. Use the search bar or the extension filters to narrow the list.
4. Click a script, then use **Run**, **Open Folder**, **Open File**, **Copy Path**, or **Pin / Unpin**.

### Organizing a managed library

The app automatically adds `script_dump` as **My Library**. Click **New Category** to
make one or more nested headings (use `/` between levels). Click **Import** to choose
multiple related scripts and copy them into the same category. Existing folders still
work as roots, so this managed library does not replace your current layout.

### Saving API calls

Click **New API**, choose its category, name it, and enter its URL and HTTP method.
The hub saves an editable `*.api.json` definition alongside your scripts. Select it
and click **Run** to send the request and show its status and response in the console.
Headers and JSON request bodies can be added by opening the definition and editing:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://example.com/api/items",
  "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer replace-me"},
  "body": {"name": "example"}
}
```

API calls use a 30-second timeout. Treat definitions like source code: do not commit
real passwords or API tokens to Git.

### Configuration

The hub stores roots and favorites in `config/script_hub.json`. You can edit that file later if you want to pre-seed a set of folders.

## Configuration

The main configuration file is `config/script_hub.json`. You can:

- Add/remove roots
- Rename root labels
- Pin favorite scripts
- Adjust the saved window size

## Troubleshooting

### "Python not found"
Install Python from https://python.org and ensure it's added to PATH.

### "PySide6 not found"
Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Scripts not running
- Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows scripts
- Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
